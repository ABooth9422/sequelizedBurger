## Burger
![](public/assets/img/burgermain.png)

The purpose of this application is to make a full-stack application with linking it to MySQL. Instead of our previous

project where we made our own ORM we are instituting sequelize as our ORM for the project. Depending on the users input

we are rendering responses with our server. Our server is then rendering our content through handlebars depending on

the route that is hit the server will determine what to render to the page.

## Install

```sh
web based application visit site to begin
```
## Technologies Used
<li>sequelize</li>
<li>handlebars</li>
<li>express</li>
<li>path</li>

## Usage!

Below there will be a list of pre-existing burgers that we have created in the my-sql database. If you

would like to devour one of these tasty burgers you can click on the button next to the burger. If you would

like to delete the burger from the table by clicking once it has been devoured you can do so by clicking the button beside 

the burger. You also have the option to add any burger that you like to the menu before it is devoured!
